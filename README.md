## Project Structure

- `EmployeeData` – Data class for employee information  
- `CheckInOutRecord` – Stores check-in and check-out timestamps  
- `EmployeeManager` – Handles employee creation, lookup, and display  
- `AttendanceTracker` – Manages attendance and working hour reporting  
- `main()` – Runs the interactive menu loop

 ## Updated Rules:
 User must type today’s date to check in/out.

No past or future dates allowed.

You want to require typing today's date (not just allow it).

 Only one check-in and one check-out allowed per employee per day.
